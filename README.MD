# TUTORIAL

## INFO
This script allows you to exchange your money for a currency that you have implemented on your es_extended server.

In this case, the script is created so that when you go to the point, you can buy chips with money and sell chips in exchange for money.

The main idea is to use this script in a casino if you have an extra currency that acts as casino chips.

## INSTALLATION

Add the script to your resources folder
Start the script in your server.cfg by adding "ensure esx_moneycasinochips"
